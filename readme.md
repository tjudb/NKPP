## NKPP - Kleene Closure Property Path Query Optimization Based on Node Clustered Index

NKPP is an optimization system designed specifically for KPPQ, which radically and significantly improves the efficiency of KPPQ by at least an order of magnitude compared to JENA and Blazegraph. The innovation of NKPP is the NCI indexing, which solves the core problem of path uncertainty in KPPQ by transforming an uncertain KPPQ into a deterministic one. We have made the code for NCI indexing publicly available so that the research community can better understand and apply our work.
